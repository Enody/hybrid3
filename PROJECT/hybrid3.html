            <h1> My Website Idea </h1>
            <p> Making an Ecommerce website which would contain a store page, a cart and a display page. this will alos include a lot of images<br/>
                and a lot of hovering and zooming feature for css. The uses will be to sell merchandise and a lot of adverising . Also it will make users <br/>be able to sign in or rigister , remember their information
                such as Name, credit card info, lat login date and so much more that will be beneficial to the website.</p>
                <h3>My Stuggles</h3>
                <p>my strugles will neccesarily be the ability to for the website to interact with the database, the ability for it to remeber user-id and password.<br/>
                    Also the ability for the websitee to be able to work across a platform, and be able to have an iterractive chat on the websitr if possible.</p>
                <h3>Other Concept to learn</h3>
                <p>Well, there is still alot to learn in terms of making the website more interractive than it would be with just the basic knowldge of linking a website <br/>to a database,
                    using of Html5 efficiently and css3 also. and learning more about angular to provide data binding and make my website testable when doing unit testing.
