        <h1>JavaScript Project Idea</h1>
        <p>I am going to make a game uasing JavaScript with tw players and if there is no other player, the computer will</br> take over as second palayer and
        will choose a number or play based on random selection.The user will tell the checkers</br> to move forward and not backward and it will continue to move forward till the reach the last line 
    of the opposite player. </br>The grid system will contain a row of 12 rows and 12 columns of square and thet will be of different colors starting,</br> skipping one square to the other.  </p>

    <p>The challenges would be using DOMs , calling objects and functions. also tryinmg to make the computer play randomly</br> and also getting the color to change once the inner circles get to the other opponents home.
        Using everything i have learned</br> in this course and also clicks to determine movement in the game. it will be such a new adventure to go through.
